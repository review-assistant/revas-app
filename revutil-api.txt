backend server address:
http://10.127.105.10:8888/

put this in a configuration dictionary at the top of the file for now.
Later we will implement configuration files separately from the code.

Example:

Client sends request with a list of review paragraphs.  Instead of
sending all of these to the server at once, break them into smaller
batches and send each separately, asynchronously. This will increase
parallelism and decrease the overall time to process the input
list. The server has a maximum batch size of 128. Make the api batch
size a configurable parameter less than this.

The server request is formatted like this (the "points" field is the list of paragraphs):

curl -X 'POST' \   
'http://10.127.105.10:8888/get_comments/v1/jobs' \   
-H 'accept: application/json' \   
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \   
-d '{   "points": [    “This is a test.", "This is another test.", "This is the last test."  ] }'

 
Server returns job id and status:

{  "job_id": "dc4e6eab-4a6c-46e7-a682-2232aec417e2",  "status": "queued" }


Then client asks job results in a loop:

curl -X 'GET' \   
'http://10.127.105.10:8888/get_comments/v1/jobs/dc4e6eab-4a6c-46e7-a682-2232aec417e2' \   
-H 'accept: application/json'


Once job completed, it is “completed”. Other possible values:  "queued", "running", "completed", "failed". Include logic to re-try a failed request a configurable number of times.

in the server response results list, "text" is the input paragraph, "aspects" is the list of label categories, and "rationale" is the comment text.

Log all traffic with the server to the console with configurable severity filtering.
